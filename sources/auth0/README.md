# Auth0
Auth0 rapidly integrates authentication and authorization for web, mobile, and legacy applications so you can focus on your core business.

You can send Auth0 logs to Segment using a Segment [Source Function](https://segment.com/docs/connections/functions/source-functions/). To get set up, take the following steps:
1. Log into your Auth0 account and follow [these instructions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/log-streams/custom-log-streams) to create a webhook stream in Auth0.
2. Log in to Segment and create a Source Function there.
3. Provide Auth0 with the webhook URL Segment spun up for your Source Function.
